# CEHv11 notes

These notes are mostly an outline of **what** a student needs to know to pass CEH v11 exam. You don't need to master every concept. Knowing everything is not far from impossible.

There are 20 modules and each module contains 2 sections:

- _concepts_, and
- _tools_.

For each module, familiarize with the _concepts_ section to get an outline of the entire CEH v11 program.

Use _tools_ for your hands-on exercises.

Do a lot of tests and simulations. You have to be ready.
