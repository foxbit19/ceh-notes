# Top 15 attacks

2. Mac flooding - targeting network switches and it use MAC table “overflow”
3. ARP spoofing/gArp cache poisoning - *switch attack* - the attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network
4. Cognitive password attack - if an employee reveals too much personal information it would be easy for miscreants to use the messages containing the personal information to work out possible passwords
5. RUDY (R-U-Dead-Yet?) - denial-of-service attack tool that aims to keep a web server tied up by submitting form data at an absurdly slow pace
6. XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
7. CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
8. SQL Injection
9. Code injection - it's a form of cyberattack where the cybercriminal injects malicious data into the code interpreter
10. PTW attack - allows an attacker to recover the secret key in less than 60 seconds in some cases
11. Connection String Parameter Pollution (CSPP) - poorly secured dynamic connections between Web apps and databases, namely ones that still use semicolons as separators between data such as the data source, user ID, and password associated with a connection to the database, for instance.
12. watering hole - targeted attack designed to compromise users within a specific industry or group of users by infecting websites they typically visit and luring them to a malicious site. The end goal is to infect the users computer and gain access to the organizations network.
13. Rubber Hose - The rubber hose attack is extracting secrets from people by use of torture or coercion.
14. Rainbow table - precomputed list of password hashes. It's an efficient way of cracking passwords for Windows Server 2003 Active Directory (AD) users
15. Email spoofing - is a technique used in spam and phishing attacks to trick users into thinking a message came from a person or entity they either know or can trust. In spoofing attacks, the sender forges email headers so that client software displays the fraudulent sender address, which most users take at face value
16. MarioNet - A browser-based attack that allows hackers to run malicious code even if users’ exit a web page
17. Wrapping attacks - aim at injecting a faked element into the message structure so that a valid signature covers the unmodified element while the faked one is processed by the application logic.
18. Cloudborne - An attack scenario affecting various cloud providers could allow an attacker to implant persistent backdoors for data theft into bare-metal cloud servers, which would be able to remain intact as the cloud infrastructure moves from customer to customer.
19. The Sybil attack - is an attack wherein a reputation system is subverted by creating multiple identities
20. aLTEr - it is implemented using a fake eNodeB (the 4G cell tower), acting as Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM)
21. Meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM) - a known plaintext attack, is a generic space–time tradeoff cryptographic attack against encryption schemes that rely on performing multiple encryption operations in sequence. The MITM attack is the primary reason why Double DES is not used and why a Triple DES key (168-bit) can be bruteforced by an attacker with 256 space and 2112 operations.
