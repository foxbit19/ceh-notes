# Module 12 - Evading IDS, Firewalls and Honeypots

## concepts
- IDS (Intrusion detection system)
    - does not stop anything
    - signature detection
    - anomaly detection
    - protocolo anomaly detection
- types of IDS
    - network-based
    - host-based
- types of alarm
    - true positive (attack -> alert)
    - false positive (no attack -> alert)
    - true negative (attack -> no alert)
    - false negative (no attack -> no alert)
- IPS (type of IDS with capability of preventing intrusions)
- Firewall (hardware vs software)
    - bastion host
    - screened subnet
    - multi-homed subnet
- packet filtering firewall 
    - works on layer 3 (internet)
- circuit-level gateway firewall
    - works on layer 4 (transport)
- application-level firewall
    - works on level 5 (application)
    - it works like a proxy server
- stateful multilayer inspection firewall
    - works on level 3, 4 and 5
- application proxy (can be merge with application-level firewall)
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Honeypot
    - it's not real, it's a trap, it's a decoy
    - emulates system resources
    - it's meant to attract an attacker
- types of honeypot
- snort rules
- IDS evasion techniques
    - obfuscating
    - overlapping fragments
    - invalid RST packets
    - urgency flag
    - polymorphic shellcode
    - Application-layer attack
    - Encryption
    - Flooding
    - ...
- firewall identification
- firewalking (it use TTL to maps network analyzing IP packet responses)
## tools
- KFSensor
- SPECTER
- Snort
