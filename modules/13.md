# Module 13 - Hacking web server

## concepts
- web servers
    - components
        - document root (HTML files or resources served in response to a request)
        - server root (server's related resources: server configurations, executables, log files)
        - virtual document tree (storage on a different machine or disk after the original disk is filled up)
        - virtual hosting (technique to hosting multiple domains on the same server)
        - web proxy (proxy server between web client and web server)
    - they are expecially vulnerable beacuse are publicy visible on the internet
    - LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
    - IIS (Internet Information Server)
    - security flaws
        - Failing to update the web server with the latest patches 
        - Using the same system administrator credentials everywhere 
        - Allowing unrestricted internal and outbound traffic 
        - Running unhardened applications and servers
    - attacks' impact
        - compromise of user account
        - website defacement
        - secondary attacks from website
        - root access to other applications or server
        - data tampering
        - data theft
        - damage reputation of the company
- attacks
    - DoS/DDoS
    - DNS server hijacking
    - DNS amplification attack
    - directory traversal attack (it uses '../' syntax to access private folders)
        - it is possibile to encode in unicode the character '/' with '%c0%'
        - there are many unicode exploits out there
    - MITM/Sniffing attack
    - phishing attack
    - website defacement
    - HTTP response-splitting attack
    - web cache poisoning attack
    - SSH brute force attack
    - web server password cracking
    - SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
- web server attack methodology
    - information gathering
        - `WHOis`
        - robots.txt
            - can give us useful information about folders that the administrator does not want to index on search engines
    - web server footprinting/banner grabbing
        - `netcat`
        - `telnet`
        - `Netcraft`
        - `httprecon`
        - `nmap`
    - website mirroring
        - find default credentials (cirt.net)
        - directory bruteforcing: find default content (`nikto`)
        - find directory listing
    - vulnerability scanning
    - session hijacking
        - `burp`
    - web server password hacking
        - `hashcat`
        - `hydra`
- metasploit
    - exploit module
- countermeasures
    - Place Web Servers in Separate Secure Server Security Segment on Network
    - patch management (automated patch management system)
        - Detect -> assess -> acquire -> test -> deploy -> maintain
    - secure protocols using best practices
    - secure accounts using best practices
    - secure files and directories using best practices
    - website change detection system
    - web server security scanners
    - UDP source port randomization defends servers against *blind response forgery*
