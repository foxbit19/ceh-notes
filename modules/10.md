# Module 10 - Denial of service

## concepts
- DoS (Denial of Service) - single attacker
- DDos (Distribuited Denial of Service) - more than 1 attacker (botnets)
- DoS/DDos attack vectors
    - volumetric attacks (NTP, DNS, SSDP)
        - The attack magnitude is measured in bits per second (bps)
        - types of bandwidth depletion attacks:
            - flood attack
            - amplification attack
    - protocol attacks
    - application layer attacks
- DoS/DDoS attack techniques
    - UDP flood attack
    - ICMP flood attack
        - Ping of death (PoS)
            - the process of riassembling an oversized packet can crash the target system
        - Smurf attack
            - amplification and reflection of spoofed ip can crash the target host
    - Pulse wave
    - Zero day
    - SYN flood attack
        - incomplete three-way handshake cause a delay window of 75 seconds (set to complete the handshake). More of these connection request could flood the avaibility of the server
    - SYN-ACK flood attack
    - ACK and PUSH ACK flood attack
    - fragmentation attack
    - spoofed session flood attack
    - GET and POST attack
        - GET attack: attacker sends incomplete header (time-delayed)
        - POST attack: attacker sends incomplete body
    - Slowloris attack
    - UDP application layer flood attack
    - Multi-vector attack
    - Peer-to-Peer attack
    - Permanent dos attack
        - plashing
        - sabotage
        - bricking system
    - DRoS (Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service)
- Botnets - huge network of compromised systems and can be used by an attacker to launch denial-of-service attacks
- Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines
    - Random
    - Hit-list
    - Topological
    - Local subnet
    - Permutation
- malicious code propagation
    - central source propagation
    - back-chaining propagation
    - autonomous propagation
- countermeasures
    - detection techniques
        - activity profiling
        - sequential change-point detection
        - wavelet-based signal analysis
    - strategies
        - absorbing the attack
        - degrading services
        - shutting down the services
    - attack countermeasures
        - Protect secondary victims 
        - Neutralize handlers 
        - Prevent potential attacks
        - Deflect attacks 
        - Mitigate attacks 
        - Post-attack forensics
- prevention mechanisms
    - egress filtering
    - ingress filtering
    - TCP intercept
    - rate limiting
- attack deflection
- attack mitigation
    - load balancing
    - throttling
    - drop requests
