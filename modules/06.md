    - located ad `c:\windows\system32\config\sam`
  - NTLM (NT Lan Manager, the auth scheme)
    - NTLM authentication protocol
    - LM (Lan Manager) protocol
      - The maximum password length is 14 characters
      - There are no distinctions between uppercase and lowercase
      - The password is split into two 7-byte halves

    - dictionary attack - a dictionary file is loaded into the cracking application that runs against user accounts
    - brute-force attack - attackers try every combination of characters until the password is broken
    - rule-based attack
      - hybrid - it uses both a dictionary attack and brute force attack
      - syllable
    - password guessing
      - steps:
        1. Find a valid user
        2. Create a list of possible passwords
        3. Rank passwords from high to low probability
        4. Key in each password, until the correct password is discovered
      - default passwords (e.g. https://open-sez.me/)
    - trojans/spywares/keyloggers
    - hash injection/pass-the-hash (PtH)
    - LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
      1. user sends request to a mispelled share system X
      2. system responds that it does know X
      3. user sends LLMNTR/NBT-NS broadcast message to all local network hosts
      4. attacker responds that knows X, accept NTLMv2 hash and sends error message

        - real-time antivirus enabled and updated
    - steganography
      - Spread Spectrum Techniques - In this technique, communication signals occupy more bandwidth than required to send the information. The sender increases the band spread by means of code (independent of data), and the receiver uses a synchronized reception with the code to recover the information from the spread spectrum data.
      - Transform Domain Techniques - The transform domain technique hides the information in significant parts of the cover image, such as cropping, compression, and some other image processing areas.
      - Substitution Techniques - In this technique, the attacker tries to encode secret information by substituting the insignificant bits with the secret message.
      - Distortion Techniques - In this technique, the user implements a sequence of modifications to the cover to obtain a stego-object. The sequence of modifications represents the transformation of a specific message.

      - attacks

        - Chosen-message: generates stego objects from a known message using specific steganography tools in order to identify the steganography algorithms.
        - Chi-square: The attacker performs probability analysis to test whether a given stego object and original data are the same or not.
        - Known-cover: The attacker compares the stego-object and the cover medium to identify the hidden message.
        - Distinguishing Statistical: The attacker analyzes the embedded algorithm used to detect distinguishing statistical changes along with the length of the embedded data

      - TCP parameters can be used by the attacker to distribute the payload and to create covert channels

- Internet covert channel - is the digital equivalent of a briefcase with a secret compartment that a spy might use to slip sensitive documents past security guards into or out of a secure facility. An attacker can use Internet covert channels to transmit sensitive documents unobserved, bypassing network security measures.

- spectre and meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/)
  - spectre - Spectre vulnerability is found in many modern processors such as AMD, ARM, Intel, Samsung, and Qualcomm processors. This vulnerability leads to tricking a processor to exploit speculative execution to read restricted data. The modern processors implement speculative execution to predict the future and to complete the execution faster.
  - meltdown - This is found in all the Intel processors and ARM processors deployed by Apple. This vulnerability leads to tricking a process to access out-of-bounds memory by exploiting CPU optimization mechanisms such as speculative execution
