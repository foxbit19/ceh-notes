- Windows authentication:
  - SAM (security account manager) database
    - located ad `c:\windows\system32\config\sam`
  - NTLM (NT Lan Manager, the auth scheme)
    - NTLM authentication protocol
    - LM (Lan Manager) protocol
  - Kerberos (default authentication method of Microsoft)
    - KDC (Key Distribution Center)
      - AS (Authentication Server)
      - TGS (Ticket Granting Server)
- password cracking
  - non-electronic attacks
    - social engineering
    - shoulder surfing

  - active online attacks
    - dictionary attack
    - brute-force attack
    - rule-based attack
      - hybrid
      - syllable
    - password guessing
      - steps:
        1. Find a valid user
        2. Create a list of possible passwords
        3. Rank passwords from high to low probability
        4. Key in each password, until the correct password is discovered
      - default passwords (e.g. https://open-sez.me/)
    - trojans/spywares/keyloggers
    - hash injection/pass-the-hash (PtH)
    - LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
      1. user sends request to a mispelled share system X
      2. system responds that it does know X
      3. user sends LLMNTR/NBT-NS broadcast message to all local network hosts
      4. attacker responds that knows X, accept NTLMv2 hash and sends error message
