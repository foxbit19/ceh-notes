# module 6 - system hacking

## concepts

- remember the 6 phases of attack
  - reconnaissance
  - scanning
  - gaining access
  - mantaining access
  - covering tracks
- CHM - CEH Hacking Methodology
  1. Footprinting
  2. Scanning
  3. Enumeration
  4. Vulnerability Analysis
  5. System Hacking
     - Gaining access
       - Cracking Passwords
       - Vulnerability exploitation
     - Escalating privileges
     - Maintaining access
       - executing applications
       - hiding files
     - Clearing Logs
       - covering tracks
- GEEHC - Gaining access, Escalating privileges, Executing applications, Hiding files, Covering tracks
- Windows authentication:
  - SAM (security account manager) database
    - located ad `c:\windows\system32\config\sam`
  - NTLM (NT Lan Manager, the auth scheme)
    - NTLM authentication protocol
    - LM (Lan Manager) protocol
  - Kerberos (default authentication method of Microsoft)
    - KDC (Key Distribution Center)
      - AS (Authentication Server)
      - TGS (Ticket Granting Server)
- password cracking
  - non-electronic attacks
    - social engineering
    - shoulder surfing
    - dumpster diving
  - active online attacks
    - dictionary attack
    - brute-force attack
    - rule-based attack
      - hybrid
      - syllable
    - password guessing
      - steps:
        1. Find a valid user
        2. Create a list of possible passwords
        3. Rank passwords from high to low probability
        4. Key in each password, until the correct password is discovered
      - default passwords (e.g. https://open-sez.me/)
    - trojans/spywares/keyloggers
    - hash injection/pass-the-hash (PtH)
    - LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
      1. user sends request to a mispelled share system X
      2. system responds that it does know X
      3. user sends LLMNTR/NBT-NS broadcast message to all local network hosts
      4. attacker responds that knows X, accept NTLMv2 hash and sends error message
    - internal monologue
    - Kerberos
      - AS-REP Roasting (cracking TGT)
      - Kerberoasting (cracking TGS)
      - Pass-the-ticket
    - Other Active Online Attacks
      - combinator
      - fingerprint
      - PRINCE (PRobability INfinite Chained Elements)
      - toggle-case
      - markov-chain
  - passive online attacks
    - wire sniffing
    - man-in-the-middle
  - offline attacks
    - rainbow table (to generate rainbow tables `rtgen`)
    - DNA (Distributed Network Attack)
      - perfomed using PRTL (Password Recovery Toolkit)
- password salting
- how to defend against password cracking
- how to defend against LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
- detect LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
  - Vindicate
  - get-responded
  - Respounder
- vulnerability exploitation (vulnerability -> exploit -> payload -> remote access)
  1. identify
  2. determine the risk associated
  3. determine the capability
  4. develop the exploit
  5. choose between local or remote delivering
  6. generate and deliver the payload
  7. gain remote acces
- buffer overflow

  - stack-based
    - EBP (Extended Base Pointer)
    - ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)
    - EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)
    - ESI (Extended Source Index)
    - EDI (Extended Destination Index)
  - heap-based
  - windows buffer overflow
    - Perform spiking
    - Perform fuzzing
    - Identify the offset
    - Overwrite the EIP register
    - Identify bad characters
    - Identify the right module
    - Generate shellcode
    - Gain root access

- privilege escalation (vertical vs horizontal)
- pivoting vs relaying
- keylogger
- spyware
- rootkit
- NTFS data stream
- steganography
  - LSB
  - watermarks
  - math
- covering tracks
  - clear_event_viewer_logs file
  - clearev in meterpreter session
  - event viewer in windows
  - /var/log in linux
