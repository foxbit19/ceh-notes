# Module 16 - Hacking Wireless Networks

## concepts
- wireless terminology (AP, BSSID, Hotspot, Association, SSID)
- authentication modes (open vs shared key)
- types of wireless antennas
    - directional
    - omnidirectional
    - parabolic
- types of wireless encryption
- TKIP (temporal key integrity protocol)
- RC4 algorithm and its weakness
- WEP, WPA and WPA2 encryption
- Rogue AP attack
    - Client Mis-association
    - Misconfigured AP Attack
    - Unauthorized association
    - Ad-Hoc connection attack
    - honeypot AP attack
- AP MAC Spoofing (it forces users to connect to out rouge AP)
- Denial-of-service attack
- KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack)
- Jamming Signal Attack
- aLTEr Attack
- Wireless Network footprinting
- wireless internface in monitor mode
    - ifconfig wlan0 down
    - airmon-ng check kill
    - airmon-ng start wlan0
- airoscript
    - once configured it is possible to sniff packates through wireshark
- fragmentation attack
    - it is a bit different than the fragmentation attack of web apps
- MAC spoofing attack
- disassociation attack
- de-authentication attack
- man-in-the-middle attack
- ARP poisoning attack
- evil twin
- WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption cracking
- WPA3 encryption cracking
    - dragonblood and so on
- bluetooth stack attacks

## tools
- aircrack suite
    - airmon-ng
- ettercap
- reaver
