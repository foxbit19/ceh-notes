# Module 20 - Cryptography

## concepts
- definition of cryptography: conversion of data into a scarambled code that is encrypted
- objective of cryptography
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - authentication
    - non repudiation
- symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
    - asymmetric is 10 times slower of symmetric one
    - symmetric needs key distribution
- types of ciphers
- DES and AES
- RC4: symmetric key cipher
- RC5: parametrized algorithm with key length of 128
- RC6: symmetric key block cipher
- DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- RSA (Rivest Shamir Adelman)
- Diffie Hellman
- Message digest (MD, one-way hash) functions
- MD5 and MD6
- Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA)
    - SHA-1 - 160bit digest
    - SHA-2 - 32 bit words and 64 bit words
    - SHA-3 - sponge construction
- RIPEDM and HMAC
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    - Registration authority (RA)
    - Certification authority (CA)
    - Validation authority (VA)
- Signed Certificate vs self-signed certificate
- Digital signature
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
    - Web of Trust (WOT)
- Disk Encryption
    - confidentiality
    - encryption
    - protection
- Code breaking methodologies
    - brute force
    - frequency analysis
    - trickery and deceit (involves the use of social engineering techniques)
    - one-time pad
- Cryptography attack
    - cyphertext-only attack
    - adaptive chosen attack
    - ...
- Birthday attack (birthday paradox)
- Side-channel attack (observing)
- Hash collision attack
- Rainbow table attack
