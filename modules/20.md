# Module 20 - Cryptography

## concepts
- definition of cryptography: conversion of data into a scarambled code that is encrypted
- objective of cryptography
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - authentication
    - non repudiation
- symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
    - asymmetric is 10 times slower of symmetric one
    - symmetric needs key distribution
- types of ciphers
    - block cypher - converts the plain text into cipher text by taking plain text’s block at a time.
    - stream cypher - are a type of encryption algorithm that processes an individual bit, byte, or character of plaintext at a time. Stream ciphers are often faster than block ciphers in hardware and require less complex circuitry.
- `DES` and `AES`
- `RC4`: Rivest Cipher 4 is a symmetric key cipher (stream cipher)
- `RC5`: parametrized algorithm with key length of 128
- `RC6`: symmetric key block cipher
- `DSA` (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- `RSA` (Rivest Shamir Adelman)
- `Diffie Hellman` - is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and it is one of _the public-key protocols_
    - DH groups determine the strength of the key used in the key exchange process
        - DH Group 1: 768-bit
        - DH Group 2: 1024-bit
        - DH Group 5: 1536-bit
        - DH Group 14: 2048-bit
        - DH Group 15: 3072-bit
- Message digest (MD, one-way hash) functions
    - `MD5` - 128 bit fixed output
    - `MD6` - variable output size
- Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA)
    - `SHA-1` - 160 bit digest
    - `SHA-2` - 32 bit words and 64 bit words, 256 bit fixed output
    - `SHA-3` - sponge construction (variable output size)
- `RIPEDM` - 160 bit fixed output
- `HMAC` - is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key
- `NTLM hashes` - 128 bit fixed output
- `twofish` - symmetric key block cypher with a block size of 128 bits, with keys up to 256 bits.
- `blowfish` - symmetric-key block cipher
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    - Registration authority (RA) - verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the CA;
    - Certificate authority (CA) - stores, issues and signs the digital certificates;
    - Central directory — a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed;
    - Certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued;
    - Certificate policy stating the PKI's requirements concerning its procedures. Its purpose is to allow outsiders to analyze the PKI's trustworthiness.
- Signed Certificate vs self-signed certificate
- Digital signature
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - vulnerable to `DROWN` (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption) attack: cross-protocol security bug that attacks servers supporting modern SSLv3/TLS protocol suites by using their support for the obsolete, insecure, SSL v2 protocol to leverage an attack on connections where the same public/private keys are shared between the servers.
- SSL stripping attack - also known as an HTTP downgrade attack, forces the client to communicate with the webserver in plain text (unencrypted) over HTTP instead of HTTPS

- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
    - Web of Trust (WOT)
- Disk Encryption
    - confidentiality
    - encryption
    - protection
- Code breaking methodologies
    - brute force
        - Attrition - brute-force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems, networks, or services
    - frequency analysis
    - trickery and deceit - involves the use of social engineering techniques to extract cryptography keys
    - one-time pad
- Cryptographic attacks
    - ciphertext-only - only the ciphertext is available
    - known-plaintext - a limited number of pairs of plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext are available
    - chosen-plaintext - ciphertexts are accessible for arbitrary encrypted plaintexts
        - adaptive chosen-plaintext - it's possibile to choose a series of plaintexts and see the resulting ciphertexts, with the opportunity at each step to analyze the previous plaintext-ciphertext pairs before choosing the next plaintext
    - chosen-ciphertext - plaintext are accessible for arbitrary decrypted ciphertext
        - adaptive chosen-ciphertext - it's possibile to choose a series of ciphertexts and see the resulting plaintexts, with the opportunity at each step to analyze the previous ciphertext-plaintext pairs before choosing the next ciphertext
- Side-channel attack - iIt refers to using other data about the encryption or decryption process to gain information about the message, such as electronic noise produced by encryption machines, sound produced by keystrokes as the plaintext is typed, or measuring how much time various computations take to perform
- Birthday attack (birthday paradox)
- Side-channel attack (observing)
- Hash collision attack
- Rainbow table attack
- ECC (Elliptic-curve cryptography) - is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. One of the main benefits of ECC over non-ECC cryptography is an application that can achieve the same level of security provided by non-ECC cryptography while using a shorter key length.
- DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) - cryptographic authentication mechanism. This can replace or supplement SPF. To configure DKIM, the organization uploads a public key as a TXT record in the DNS server
- partial breaks
    - Total break — the attacker deduces the secret key.
    - Global deduction — the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.
    - Instance (local) deduction — the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
    - Information deduction — the attacker gains some Shannon information about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
    - Distinguishing algorithm — the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation.
