- phases
    - research target
    - select a target
    - develop a relationship
    - exploit the relationship
- types of social engineering
    - human based 
        - Impersonation (e.g. impersonation on facebook)

        - Honey Trap - an attacker pretends to be an attractive person and fakes an online relationship, in order to get sensitive information from their victim.
        - Baiting 
        - Quid Pro Quo - low-level attackers call random numbers claiming to be from technical support, and will offer some sort of assistance. Once in a while, they find people with legitimate technical problems and will then "help" them to solve those problems. They guide them through the necessary steps, which then gives the attackers access to the victims' computers or the ability to launch malware.
        - Elicitation - is the strategic use of casual conversation to extract information from people (targets) without giving them the feeling that they are being interrogated or pressed for the information
    - computer based 
        - hoax letters
        - chain letters
        - phishing
            - spear phishing

        - spam mail
        - scareware
        - instant chat messenger
    - mobile based
        - publishing malicious apps
        - using fake security applications
        - repacking legitimate apps
        - SMiShing (SMS phishing)
- insider threats (may be useful pentest+ table classification)
