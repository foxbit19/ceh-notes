# Module 2 - Footprinting

## concepts
- passive footprinting:
    - Finding information through search engines (google dork, GHDB)
    - Finding the Top-level Domains (TLDs) and sub-domains of a target through web services
    - Collecting location information on the target through web services
    - Performing people search using social networking sites and people search services
    - Gathering financial information about the target through financial services
    - Gathering infrastructure details of the target organization through job sites
    - Collecting information through deep web (web pages hidden and unindexed) and dark web (subset of deep web with anonymous navigation) footprinting
    - Determining the operating systems in use by the target organization
    - Performing competitive intelligence o Monitoring the target using alert services (google alerts or twitter alerts and ORM - online reputation management)
    - ORM (online reputation management))
    - Gathering information using groups, forums, blogs, and NNTP Usenet newsgroups
    - Collecting information through social engineering on social networking sites
    - Extracting information about the target using Internet archives
    - Gathering information using business profile sites
    - Monitoring website traffic of the target
    - Tracking the online reputation of the target
- active footprinting:
    - Querying published name servers of the target
    - Searching for digital files
    - Extracting website links and gathering wordlists from the target website
    - Extracting metadata of published documents and files
    - Gathering website information using web spidering and mirroring tools
    - Gathering information through email tracking
    - Harvesting email lists
    - Performing Whois lookup
    - Extracting DNS information
    - Performing traceroute analysis
    - Performing social engineering
- footprinting objectives:
    - Know Security Posture
    - Reduce Focus Area
    - Identify Vulnerabilities
    - Draw network map
- footptinting threats
    - social engineering
    - system and network attacks
    - information leakage
    - privacy loss
    - corporate espionage
    - business loss
- footprinting metodology:
    - search engines
        - google dork syntax
        - image reverse search
        - video data search
        - meta seach engines
        - ftp search engines
        - IoT search engines
    - TLD and subdomains:
        - site:microsoft.com -inurl:www
    - financial services
    - job services
    - deep/dark web footprinting
    - operating system footpriting (shodan, censys)
    - VoIP and VPN (shodan)
- competitive intelligence gathering
    - direct approach
    - indirect approach
- location search
- website footprinting
    - examinate responses
    - examinate sourcecode
    - examinate cookies
    - using web spiders
- mirror entire web site
- extract web site information (archive.org)
- extract web site links
- extract words from the target website -> for password cracking
- email tracking
- whois lookups
- ip geolocation information
- dns information
    - `A` -> IPv4 address of a given domain
    - `AAAA` -> IPv6 address of a given domain
    - `MX` -> domain's mail server
    - `NS` -> host's name server
    - `CNAME` -> aliases to host
    - `SOA` -> Start of Authority
    - `SRV` -> service records
    - `PTR` -> ip address to hostname
    - `RP` -> responsible person
    - `HINFO` -> host information include CPU and OS
    - `TXT` -> unstructured text record (usually used for comments)
- SOA stores important information about a domain or zone
    - the primary name server of the domain
    - the email address of the admin
    - the last update of domain
    - the time the server should wait before the refresh
    - **it can specify how long does a DNS poisoning will last.**

> **When the serial number within the SOA record of the primary server is higher than the Serial number within the SOA record of the secondary DNS server, a zone transfer will take place**.

- reverse DNS lookup using dnsrecon
    - dnsrecon -r 162.241.216.0-162.241.216.25
- locate network range (using arin tool)
- traceroute
    - icmp
    - tcp
    - udp
- footprinting through social engineering:
    - eavesdropping
    - shoudler surfing
    - dumpster diving
    - impersonation
- footprinting countermeasures
