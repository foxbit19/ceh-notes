# Module 8 - Sniffing

## concepts
- sniffers operate at the second layer of the OSI model: data link
- network sniffing
    - types of ethernet
        - shared
        - switched
            - ARP spoofing - A machine can send an ARP reply even without asking for it
            - MAC flooding
- types of sniffing
    - passive sniffing (hub environment)
        - compromising phisical security
        - using a trojan horse
        - Passive sniffing provides significant stealth advantages over active sniffing
    - active sniffing (switch environment)
        - MAC flooding - is a technique used to compromise the security of network switches that connect network segments or devices
        - DNS poisoning
        - ARP poisoning 
        - DHCP attacks 
        - Switch port stealing 
        - Spoofing attack
- vulnerable (that send info in clear text)
    - telnet
    - rlogin
    - http
    - pop
    - imap
    - smtp
    - nntp
    - ftp
- hardware protocol analyzer
    - Voyager M4x Protocol Analyzer 
    - N2X N5540A Agilent Protocol Analyzer
- span port
- wiretapping (or telephone tapping) - refers to the monitoring of telephone or Internet conversations by a third party with covert intentions
    - active (MITM)
    - passive (snooping or eavesdropping)
- lawful interception
- sniffing techniques
    - mac 
        - 48 bits: 24 bits for OUI (Organization Unique Identifier), 24 bits for NIC specific
        - CAM table
        - sniffing
            - flooding (flooding the CAM table)
            - switch port stealing
            - spoofing (and defense technique using snooping table)
    - dhcp
        - starvation attack
        - rogue server attack
    - arp
        - spoofing attack
        - poisoning attack
    - IRDP (ICMP Router Discovery Protocol) spoofing 
    - VLAN Hopping
        - switch spoofing - the attacker connects a rogue switch into the network by tricking a legitimate switch and thereby creating a trunk link between them
        - double tagging
    - STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) attack
    - DNS
        - poisoning
        - spoofing
        - difference between intranet and internet
        - cache poisoning
- How to defend agains MAC spoofing
    - DHCP snooping bind table - filters untrusted DHCP messages and helps to build and bind a DHCP binding table
    - Dynamic ARP inspection - checks the IPâ€“MAC address binding for each ARP packet in a network
    - IP Source guard - is a security feature in switches that restricts the IP traffic on untrusted layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on the DHCP snooping binding database
    - Encryption
    - Retrieval of MAC address
    - Implementation of IEEE 802.1X Suites - protocol for port-based Network Access Control (PNAC), and its main purpose is to enforce access control at the point where a user joins the network
    - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)
- sniffing detection
    - nmap 'sniffer-detect' script (promiscious)

### wireshark special
- filters
    - 'pop' to filter by protocol
    - 'ip.addr' to filter by ip address
    - 'ip.src' to filter by ip address
    - 'ip.dst' to filter by ip address
