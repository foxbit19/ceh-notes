# Module 5 - vulnerability analysis

## concepts

- vulnerability assessmnent
  - 2 main causes:
    1. software or hardware misconfiguration
    2. poor programming practices
- vulnerability research
- CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scoring System

  - metrics:
    - Base
    - Temporal
    - Environmental
  - score (`3.0` and `3.1`)
