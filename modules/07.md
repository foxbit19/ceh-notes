# module 7 - malware threats

## concepts
- major types of malware (worms, rootkits, spyware, trojan, virus, ransomware, keyloggers)
- way to enter a system
- malware distribution techniques
    - Social Engineered Click-jacking - Attackers inject malware into websites that appear legitimate to trick users into clicking them. When clicked, the malware embedded in the link executes without the knowledge or consent of the user
    - Malvertising - involves embedding malware-laden advertisements in legitimate online advertising channels to spread malware on systems of unsuspecting users
    - Black hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - unethical SEO uses aggressive SEO tactics such as keyword stuffing, inserting doorway pages, page swapping, and adding unrelated keywords to get higher search engine rankings for malware pages
