# Module 1 - Introduction to ethical hacking

## concepts
- definition of information security
- elements of information security (CIA)
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - availability
- extension of CIA
    - authenticity (smart cards, biometrics, digital certs)
    - non-repudation (digital signature)
- attack = motive (goal) + method + vulnerability
- classification of attacks
    - passive
    - active
    - close-in
    - insider
    - distribution
- information warfare
- cyber kill chain methodology (7):
    - recon
    - weponization
    - deliery
    - exploitation
    - installation
    - command control
    - action and objectives
- TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
- Adversary Behavioral Identification
- IoCs (indicators of compromise)
- Hacking and hacker definition
- Hacker classes
- Hacking phases (5):
    - recoinnaissance
        - passive
        - active
    - scanning
        - pre-attack
        - port scanner
        - extract information
    - gaining access
        - access to operating system or application
        - privileges escalation
        - password cracking
        - session hijacking
    - maintaing access
        - backdoor
        - rootkit
    - clearing tracks
- ethical hacking
    - do the same things of a bad guys:
        - with permission
        - for defences purposes
- information assurance (IA)
    - defense-in-depth
- risk = threat * vulnerability * impact
- risk level = conseguence * likelihood
    - consequence: The severity of a risk event that occurs
    - likelihood: The chance of the risk occurring 
- risk management
    - identification
    - assessment
    - treatment
    - tracking
    - review
- CTI (cyber thread intelligence)
    - Strategic Threat Intelligence
    - Tactical Threat Intelligence 
    - Operational Threat Intelligence
    - Technical Threat Intelligence
- threat modeling:
    - Identify Security Objectives
    - Application Overview 
    - Decompose the Application 
    - Identify Threat
    - Identify Vulnerabilities
- incident management
- incident handling and response:
    - Prepration
    - Incident Recording and Assignment
    - Incident Triage 
    - Notification
    - Containment
    - Evidence Gathering and Forensic Analysis 
    - Eradication
    - Recovery
    - Post-Incident Activities
- role of AI and ML in cybersecurity
- information security laws and standards
    - PCI DSS
    - ISO 27001
    - HIPAA
    - SOX
    - DMCA
    - FISMA
