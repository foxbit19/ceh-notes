# Main nmap commands (and some hping counterparts)

- `-sS` - SYN scan (or stealth scan)
- `-sI` - IDLE scan
- `-sT` - TCP connect scan (is used when the SYN scan is not an option). It is slower than SYN scan
    - `hping -8`
- `-sA` - This scan is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered
- `-6` - scan IPv6 target
- `-p <ports>` - scan specific ports
- `-F` - (fast) scan fewer ports than the default scan
- `-O` - enable OS detection (requires root privileges)
- `-sV` - service version detection
- `-sn` - disable port scan (this is often known as a “ping scan”)
- `-sX` - XMAS scan (FIN, URG, PSH)
    - `hping -FUP`
- `-sF` - FIN scan
    - `hping -F`
- `-sN` - NULL scan
- `-sM` - Maimon Scan (FIN/ACK)
- `--script <filename>` - scan using NSE (nmap script engine)
    - `-sC` - performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to `--script=default`
- `-Pn` - skip host discovery (no ping before port scan)
- `-PP` - ICMP timestamp ping scan
- `-PY` - SCTP init ping
- `-PS` - TCP SYN ping scan
- `-T<n>` - timing (lower is better for stealth and the first two are for IDS evasion)
    - `-T0` - paranoid, a packet every 5m (IDS evasion)
    - `-T1` - sneaky, a packet every 15s (IDS evasion)
    - `-T2` - polite, a packet every 0,4s
    - `-T3` - normal (default)
    - `-T4` - agressive, a packet every 10ms
    - `-T5` - insane, a packet every 5ms
- `-S <IP_Address>` - Spoof source address
- `-D <decoy1,decoy2[,ME],...>` - Cloak a scan with decoys (use a set of spoofed IP addresses)
- `-f; --mtu <val>`: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU)
