# Good to know concepts

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
From top to bottom

- 7 - Application
- 6 - Presentation
- 5 - Session
- 4 - Transport
- 3 - Network
- 2 - Data link
- 1 - Physical

## Lockheed Martin kill chain
1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command and Control
7. Actions on Objective

## Main ways to manage risks
1. acceptance
2. avoidance
3. transference
4. mitigation
5. exploitation

## Dns records
- `A ` -> host ip address
- `MX` -> domain's mail server
- `NS` -> host's name server
- `CNAME` -> aliases to host
- `SOA` -> Start of Authority
- `SRV` -> service records
- `PTR` -> ip address to hostname
- `RP` -> responsible person
- `HINFO` -> host information include CPU and OS
- `TXT` -> unstructured text record (usually used for comments)

> The SOA stores important information about a domain or zone such as the primary name server of the domain, the email address of the admin, the last update of domain, the time the server should wait before the refresh. 

> It can specify how long does a DNS poisoning will last.

> **When the serial number within the SOA record of the primary server is higher than the Serial number within the SOA record of the secondary DNS server, a zone transfer will take place**.

## TCP flags

- SYN
- ACK
- FIN
- RST
- PSH
- URG
## Three-way handshake
Connection Establishment: `SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`

Connection Termination: `FIN`, `ACK-FIN`, `ACK`

## OWASP top 10 (2017)

1. Injection
2. Broken authentication
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML External Entity (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross Site Sripting (XSS)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Use components with know vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging and monitoring

##  N-tier architecture
- presentation tier - user interface
- logic tier - coordinates apps, commands
- data tier - storage

Tier-1: Developer machines - image creation, testing and accreditation

Tier-2: Testing and accreditation systems - verification and validation of image contents, signing images and sending them to the registries

Tier-3: Registries - storing images and disseminating images to the orchestrators based on requests

Tier-4: Orchestrators - transforming images into containers and deploying containers to hosts

Tier-5: Hosts - operating and managing containers as instructed by the orchestrator



## PKI
- Certificate authority (CA) - stores, issues and signs the digital certificates;
- Registration authority (RA) - verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the CA;
- Central directory â€” a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed;
- Certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued;
- Certificate policy stating the PKI's requirements concerning its procedures. Its purpose is to allow outsiders to analyze the PKI's trustworthiness.

## IoT architecture (from top to bottom)

- `application layer` - Delivery of various applications to different users in IoT
- `middleware layer` - Device management and information management
- `internet layer` - Connection between endpoints
- `access gateway layer` - Protocol translation and messaging
- `edge technology layer` - Sensors, devices, machines, and intelligent edge nodes of various types
